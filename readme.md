## Description
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, the object of this project was to develop a tic, tac, toe game. 

### The rules
Tic Tac Toe is a classic, well-known two-player game. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. If after 9 turns no player made consecutives of 3, then the game ends up in a tie.
